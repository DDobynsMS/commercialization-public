# Windows Hardware Lab Kit

The Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) is a test framework used to test hardware devices for Windows 10. To qualify for the [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/), your product must pass certain tests using the Windows HLK.

This guide provides information about the tests that are included in the Windows Hardware Lab Kit, and instructions on how to build a test environment, automate driver and system testing, and create a submission package required to participate in the [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/).
